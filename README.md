# Hey, I'm Liam 👋

**Computer Science @ UNC Charlotte** | AI & Robotics Concentration | Math Minor

I'm interested in building real systems with AI/ML—from reinforcement learning experiments to developer tools that actually ship. Currently exploring how to bridge research concepts with practical, deployable implementations.

## What I'm Working On

🎮 **Game AI & RL** — Training agents in custom environments, building tooling for analysis and playback  
🧠 **Applied ML** — Supervised learning pipelines, NLP, model evaluation  
🛠️ **Developer Tools** — Chrome extensions, CLI utilities, MCP servers for AI coordination
